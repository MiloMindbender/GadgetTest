I was experimenting with virtual sets in Unreal and decided to put the project up on github so I could easily work on it in multiple locations.  If you are also interested in this, please feel free to look at and experiment with this project.  This includes a few of Epic's "forever free for use with Unreal" assets which is the reason it is so large.

Currently this is setup for a logitech 920pro webcam with a Vive tracker attached.  All it really does right now is setup a tracked camera and a composite so the character will show up standing in the room that the camera is looking at.

It's a bit rough, the system for syncing up the engine with the tracker isn't spot on yet.  I'm looking for solutions.

If anyone has suggestions on how to do this better, please contact me!
